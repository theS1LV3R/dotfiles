# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles i chose to keep between my linux installs. Nothing really special about them.

## Cloning and installing

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:theS1LV3R/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

# Enter into the repo
cd .dotfiles

# Install dotfiles using dotbot
chmod +x install && ./install
```
